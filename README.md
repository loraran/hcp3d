# ðŸ“‰ XRD Simulation of Interfaces in HCP Crystals

MATLAB XRD simulations of hcp bulk crystals. MSc project (2017-2019).

**_NOTE:_ Upload is still ongowing as of 2021.**

This repository consists of all scripts developed in MATLAB to simulate X-ray diffraction line profiles of hexagonal close-packed bulk crystals with grain interfaces. The scripts are separated into two folders: `hcp3d/sim` lists all scripts dedicated to the simulation routines performed, and `hcp3d/extras` lists all scripts developed to extract images and perform pertinent calculations to extract further information on the XRD data obtained. A full description of the scripts contained in the repository can be found below.

A research paper was published using results obtained from these scripts. You can find it here:

## _hcp3d/sim_
### Simulation Routines

* _`hcp3d_fulltilt.m`_ - HCP3D main script. Executes all relevant scripts, calling functions in the correct order.
* _`hcp3d_lattice.m`_ - Crystal lattice assembly. Defines lattice parameters and matrix size, sets up a spherical matrix.
* _`hcp3d_projections.m`_ - Generates specified projections of the matrix created by `hcp3d_lattice`: (100), (110).
* Collection of functions that perform progressive rotation and cutting of the projected matrices:
  * _`hcp3d_progcut_alpha.m`_ - Progressive rotation, cutting and assembly of _out-of-plane_ Î±-type interfaces.
  * _`hcp3d_progcut_beta.m`_ - Progressive rotation, cutting and assembly of _out-of-plane_ Î²-type interfaces.
  * _`hcp3d_progcut_gammaZ.m`_ - Progressive rotation, cutting and assembly of _out-of-plane_ Î³-type interfaces.
  * _`hcp3d_progcut_gammaX.m`_ - Progressive rotation, cutting and assembly of _in-plane_ Î³-type interfaces.
* _`hcp3d_fft.m`_ - Fast-Fourier Transform of assembled out-of-plane lattices Î±, Î² and Î³. Varies l with 0.006 steps.
* Collection of functions that perform Fast-Fourier Transform of assembled lattices Î³ (in-plane): **_[ADD]_**
  * _`hcp3d_fftX_fftXh.m`_ - Varies h with 0.006 steps. **_[ADD]_**

## _hcp3d/extras_
### Extraction of Atom Matrix Figures for POV-Rayâ„¢
>The [_Persistence of Vision Raytracerâ„¢_](http://www.povray.org/) (_POV-Rayâ„¢_) is a tool for producing high-quality computer graphics. POV-Ray is a free and open-source software >with source code available under the AGPLv3.

* Collection of scripts to assist the creation on images to better illustrate relevant assembled lattices (all atom positions are preserved). They create _.pov_ files to be visualized in POV-Ray.
  * _`_bulk.m`_ - Creates _.pov_ files to generate images for the bulk matrix.
  * _`_alpha.m`_ - Creates _.pov_ files to generate images for _out-of-plane_ Î±-type interfaces.
  * _`_beta.m`_ - Creates _.pov_ files to generate images for _out-of-plane_ Î²-type interfaces.
  * _`_gamma.m`_ - Creates _.pov_ files to generate images for _out-of-plane_ Î³-type interfaces.

### Data Retrieval

* _`angulos.m`_ - Convertion of atom coordinates into rotation angles.
* _`Lcalc.m`_ - Estimates Miller indexes (_l_ only).
* _`strain.m`_ - Calculates maximum estimated strain (1D distortion).
* _`reverseangulos.m`_ - Convertion of rotation angles into atom coordinates. **_[unused, unfinished]_**
